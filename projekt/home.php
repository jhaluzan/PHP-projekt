            <p>
                Supporting a growing ecosystem for AI-RAN, the new platform will transform radio access network (RAN) technology into AI-driven computing infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Telecommunications providers are transforming beyond voice and data services with an AI computing infrastructure to optimize wireless networks and serve the next-generation needs of generative AI on mobile, robots, autonomous vehicles, smart factories, 5G and much more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Launched today, NVIDIA AI Aerial is a suite of accelerated computing software and hardware for designing, simulating, training and deploying AI radio access network technology for wireless networks in the AI era.
            </p>
            <p>
                The platform will become a critical foundation to allow network optimization at scale to serve the demands of a host of new services. This will provide significant savings in total cost of ownership and open telecom operators to new revenue opportunities for enterprise and consumer services.
